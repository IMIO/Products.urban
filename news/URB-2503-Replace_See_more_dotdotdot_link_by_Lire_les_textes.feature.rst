Improve / translate "See more..." link text

I had to translate "See more..." and decided that "Lire les textes" would be a better translation for better readability and accessibility.
The context is a link that follows "Textes du point Délib: See more...".
Now it reads "Textes du point Délib: Lire les textes".
